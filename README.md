# HR-Management-Portal-
End-to-End QA for Comprehensive HR Management Portal 

**Client Overview:**

The client developed a robust HR management portal aimed at streamlining the complete employee lifecycle — from onboarding to payroll. Key modules included employee onboarding, real-time attendance tracking, leave management, shift scheduling, and automated payroll processing.

**Project Objective:**

To ensure the platform's functionality, usability, data integrity, and cross-platform compatibility through thorough QA practices — both manual and automated.

**QA Responsibilities & Approach:**

**1. Functional Testing:**
   
---Verified all core functionalities including onboarding workflows, leave request/approval cycles, and shift card tracking.

---Validated edge cases such as overlapping leave requests and shift conflicts to ensure accurate system behavior.

**2. UI & Usability Testing:**
   
---Ensured consistent and intuitive UI across modules.

---Performed cross-browser and cross-device checks to guarantee responsive design and accessibility.

**3. Regression Testing:**
   
---Created and maintained regression suites to ensure stability after every deployment or module update.

**4. Payroll & Payslip Validation:**
   
---Rigorously tested the salary computation logic based on different pay structures, deductions, and attendance records.

---Verified accurate generation and secure download of payslips for various user roles.

**5. Access Control & Data Integrity:**
   
---Ensured strict role-based access to sensitive HR data, verifying that only authorized personnel could perform modifications.

---Conducted negative testing to catch unauthorized access attempts or data manipulation risks.

**6. Automation Testing:**
    
---Developed test scripts for repetitive tasks such as login workflows, leave submissions, and report generation to speed up test cycles.

---Integrated automation into CI/CD for early bug detection.

**Results:**

1. Reduced defect leakage by 85% through robust QA cycles.
   
2. Achieved 100% test coverage on critical modules before launch.

3. Enhanced platform reliability, enabling HR teams to manage thousands of employees with zero post-launch incidents.
