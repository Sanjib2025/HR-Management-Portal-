# HR-Management-Portal-
End-to-End QA for Comprehensive HR Management Portal 
I was responsible with the QA testing of a full-fledged HR management platform that streamlines employee onboarding, attendance, leave management, and payroll processing. The system allows admins to create custom leave policies by location, provides a centralized shift card to view employee attendance in real time, and includes a payroll module for automated salary computation.

As QA conducted functional, UI, and regression testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of each module. We validated edge cases such as overlapping leaves, shift mismatches, and pay calculation logic. The payslip generation and download functionality was rigorously tested across various user roles and salary structures. We also checked compliance with access control and data integrity protocols to ensure only authorized HR personnel could modify or access sensitive information.

Through test automation and manual validations, we ensured the portal delivers a seamless, error-free experience across devices and browsers, providing HR teams with the confidence to manage large-scale employee operations efficiently.
